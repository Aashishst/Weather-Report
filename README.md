# Weather-Report
The website is a detailed forecast tailored to show the weather of Indian states and their major cities, it includes graphs maps and other tooltips to help you understand. Getting Started is in the About Page. It is an In-Progress Website

##  Tips
A few tips to follow --

***API*** - The API in use is *Open Metero API*. It is a free non-commercial API. It is used to display the weather Output in the Project.

***Location*** - The API may not provide weather for some locations in the Maps. The main issue is about the locations which can be fixed with a bit of work.

***Uses*** - This Website is based on Indian Weather. For other Countries you can do the Tweaks.

## Tweaks

### To make your version of other Countries follow the Steps

***S1:***  Make the clone of the Repository. In the top right section you will find the fork option.

***S2:***  Access the **Weather html** file and find the search options to change to your countries states.

***S3:***  Then go to the JS and check for the **States to Cities dict**. You will find thee cities and change them according to your liking.

***S4:***  Do the smae for the **Graph Files** and you can check for the same and change the same.

### Fixes

***Location*** - The location errors may be fixed by hardcoding the *Correct spelling* by checking the API documentation or Changing the API.

***API*** -  The alternative for ***Open Metero API*** is another 14-day free trail API namely ***WeatherAPI*** which I tested but found Not good enough for the Graphs. However considering the Locations the Alternative is to use a both for other Purposes. One for *Graphs* and the other for *Locations*.

***Addons*** -  You can also make additions to the Website such as extra maps or any other features you like.
